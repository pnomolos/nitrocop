/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-03-09)
///
/// Corpus oracle reported FP=2,772, FN=12,368 (29.2% match rate).
///
/// ### Root causes identified:
///
/// 1. **Trailing dot style completely unhandled** — When the dot is at the end
///    of a line (`a.\n  b`), the selector on the next line was never checked.
///    RuboCop's `right_hand_side` returns either the dot+selector (for leading
///    dot) or just the selector (for trailing dot), and `begins_its_line?`
///    determines if the RHS starts its line. This was the single biggest source
///    of FNs.
///
/// 2. **Semantic alignment base (`get_dot_right_above`)** — For the "aligned"
///    style, RuboCop first checks if there's a dot on the line directly above at
///    the same column (walking up through ancestors). This was implemented
///    differently and incorrectly via `find_alignment_dot_col` which only walked
///    up the receiver chain, not through all ancestors.
///
/// 3. **`not_for_this_cop?` logic** — RuboCop skips chains inside grouped
///    expressions and inside parenthesized arg lists (but NOT hash pair values).
///    Our `in_paren_args` tracking was overly simplified.
///
/// 4. **Assignment RHS alignment** — For `a = b.c.\n    d`, the alignment base
///    should be `b.c.` (the chain root on the assignment RHS). RuboCop uses
///    `syntactic_alignment_base` which handles assignment context.
///
/// 5. **Message generation** — Alignment base descriptions used wrong text,
///    e.g., showing chain root `User` instead of the actual alignment node
///    `.a` when the first dot is the alignment base.
///
/// ### Fixes applied:
///
/// - Added trailing dot detection: when `call_operator_loc` is on the previous
///   line AND the selector/message_loc starts a new line, treat it as a
///   multiline call with the selector as the RHS.
/// - Rewrote alignment base calculation to match RuboCop's semantic/syntactic
///   alignment approach.
/// - Fixed hash pair value chain alignment.
/// - Fixed message generation for alignment base descriptions.
///
/// ### Known remaining gaps:
///
/// - `indented` and `indented_relative_to_receiver` styles may have edge cases
///   with keyword expressions and block chains.
/// - Some complex patterns involving operation RHS (`a + b\n    .c`) may not
///   be fully handled.
///
/// ## Corpus investigation (2026-04-01, run 23848128960, timed out)
///
/// Baseline: 32,658 matches, 3,962 FP, 7,992 FN (73.2% match rate).
///
/// Attempted fix with three major changes:
/// 1. **Aligned style fallback** — introduced `AlignedExpectation::Base` vs
///    `Fallback`. When no semantic alignment base exists (no dot above, no
///    block chain, no syntactic anchor), fall back to normal indentation
///    (`lhs_indent + width`) instead of accepting any column.
/// 2. **Receiver-chain continuation dot tightening** — added
///    `continuation_anchor_is_valid()` to only reuse an earlier continuation
///    dot when the chain's first continuation call is itself correctly anchored.
/// 3. **Assignment RHS across lines** — added `starts_rhs_after_assignment_line()`
///    to handle `resources =\n  Constant\n    .new(...)` where `=` is on a
///    previous line.
///
/// Also added ancestor tracking (`Vec<Node>`) to ChainVisitor for
/// `find_dot_right_above()` and `find_logical_operator_alignment()`.
///
/// Result: last corpus check showed +623 FP (worse), -437 FP (better),
/// -4 FN (better). Net +186 FP regression. The fallback indentation was
/// firing too aggressively — patterns like standalone method calls at column 0
/// (e.g., `.where(...)` after a long expression) were being flagged. The
/// `continuation_anchor_is_valid()` check was also too strict, rejecting
/// valid continuation dot alignments in some cases.
///
/// An earlier intermediate state showed +154 worse / -321 better (net -167,
/// close to positive), suggesting the approach can work with narrower
/// fallback scoping.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-04)
///
/// Baseline: 32,654 matches, 3,962 FP, 7,992 FN (73.2% match rate).
///
/// Two targeted changes:
///
/// 1. **Aligned style fallback to indented behavior** — When `expected_aligned`
///    returns `None` (no semantic or syntactic alignment base), we now fall
///    back to the indented calculation (`base_indent + width`) instead of
///    skipping the check entirely. This matches RuboCop's behavior in
///    `check_regular_indentation` where `@base` is nil.
///
/// 2. **Multi-line assignment detection** — Extended `find_syntactic_alignment`
///    to detect assignment context when `=` is on the previous line (e.g.,
///    `a =\n  b\n  .c`). The existing `assignment_context_base_col` only
///    checked the same line.
///
/// Also fixed `expected_aligned_hash_pair` to return `Some(rhs_col)` instead
/// of `None` for "accept" cases, preventing the fallback from incorrectly
/// flagging hash pair values that are properly aligned.
///
/// Sample-15 corpus validation: 0 FP regression, 0 FN regression,
/// -431 FP resolved, -4,416 FN resolved.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-08)
///
/// Baseline: 38,410 matches, 4,625 FP, 2,231 FN.
///
/// Added `find_current_node_block_continuation` — RuboCop's
/// `find_continuation_node` logic. When the current call has a block
/// (do..end or { }) and the receiver has a continuation dot (dot on a
/// line after the receiver's receiver's end), use the receiver's dot
/// column as the alignment base. This prevents flagging block-bearing
/// calls like `.map { }`, `.collect { }`, `.each do...end` at the end
/// of misaligned chains.
///
/// Sample-15 corpus validation: 0 FP regression, 0 FN regression,
/// -1,092 FP resolved, -329 FN resolved.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-11)
///
/// Baseline: 38,410 matches, 3,184 FP, 2,231 FN.
///
/// Added text-based `get_dot_right_above` check. RuboCop walks AST
/// ancestors to find a dot on the line directly above at the same
/// column. Since nitrocop doesn't track parent pointers, we scan the
/// text of the previous line instead, but only accept the match when
/// the dot is NOT in the current call's receiver chain (to avoid
/// suppressing legitimate receiver-chain alignment checks).
///
/// Root cause: in Prism's AST, calls inside non-parenthesized arguments
/// have a receiver chain that diverges from the visual nesting. E.g.,
/// `.and` in `expect { }.to(...).and(...)` chains on `.with_payload`
/// (an inner call), not on `.to`. RuboCop's ancestor traversal finds
/// `.to`'s dot directly above; our receiver-chain-only approach missed it.
///
/// This fixes the most common FP pattern: RSpec matcher chains with
/// `.to ... .and ...` where continuation dots are properly aligned with
/// each other but flagged because the receiver chain leads to an inline
/// dot at a different column.
///
/// Sample-15 corpus validation: 0 FP regression, 0 FN regression,
/// -1,324 FP resolved, -190 FN resolved.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-17)
///
/// Two remaining FN clusters came from Prism details that are narrower than
/// the current port treated them:
///
/// 1. `call.block()` is present for both real blocks (`{}` / `do..end`) and
///    block-pass arguments (`&:strip`). RuboCop's block-chain alignment only
///    applies to real blocks, so calls like `.collect(&:strip)\n  .compact`
///    must still align `.compact` with the earlier chain base instead of with
///    `.collect`.
/// 2. Prism exposes `opening_loc` for `[]` / `[]=` calls as well as `(` arg
///    lists. For the default `aligned` style, RuboCop's
///    `inside_arg_list_parentheses?` only skips actual `(` argument lists, so
///    chains in `[]=` RHS expressions such as
///    `headers['Cookie'] = final_cookies_hash.\n  map { ... }` must still be
///    checked. The non-default styles keep the older broad skip behavior for
///    now because narrowing them regressed their corpus baselines.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-17)
///
/// Two more FN patterns came from custom shortcuts that RuboCop does not use:
///
/// 1. Setter calls like `receiver.\n    name = value` were skipped entirely.
///    RuboCop still checks those nodes; only the parent walk used for the left
///    hand side ignores assignment-method ancestors.
/// 2. Reusing any earlier continuation dot in the receiver chain was too
///    broad. If the first continuation dot is already misindented, later calls
///    like `.arel` and `.and_return` must still be checked against the chain
///    base instead of inheriting that bad column.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-19)
///
/// Two remaining divergences came from treating visual continuations too
/// broadly:
///
/// 1. Trailing-dot matcher chains nested in non-parenthesized arguments, such
///    as `expect(...).\n  to receive(...).with(...).\n  and_return(...)`, do
///    not get an aligned semantic base in RuboCop. They fall back to the outer
///    visual chain indentation, so later `and_return` / `and change` lines must
///    use the indentation-based check rather than an `Align ... with ...`
///    comparison against the inner matcher chain.
/// 2. A valid continuation line that is only valid because its receiver had a
///    single-line block (for example `.unshift` after `.map { ... }`) is not a
///    reusable anchor for later continuation dots. RuboCop still flags the next
///    `.unshift`; only anchors that remain valid without that direct receiver-
///    block shortcut should be inherited.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-19)
///
/// Two concentrated FN clusters were caused by missing RuboCop
/// `syntactic_alignment_base` cases for leading-dot continuations:
///
/// 1. Chains inside keyword conditions such as `if stripe_mapping\n    .select`
///    must align with the full condition expression (`stripe_mapping` or
///    `mixpanel_mapping && mixpanel_mapping`), not with the generic
///    indentation fallback.
/// 2. Chains inside operator RHS expressions such as `+ expr\n    .replace`
///    keep that operator RHS as their alignment base for every later
///    continuation; accepting later dots just because an earlier continuation
///    existed hid multiple real offenses in the same chain.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-20)
///
/// Later continuation dots in a long leading-dot chain must not become valid
/// merely because there are multiple earlier continuation lines. RuboCop only
/// reuses an earlier continuation column when that earlier continuation is
/// itself a valid anchor, or in the existing multiline-block special case.
/// Without that check, chains like:
///
/// ```ruby
/// scope do
///   alive
///   .where(...)
///   .joins(...)
///   .order(...)
/// end
/// ```
///
/// incorrectly stopped reporting offenses after the first one or two lines.
///
/// ## Variant fix (2026-04-19)
///
/// For `EnforcedStyle: indented`, matcher chains nested inside a
/// non-parenthesized argument need RuboCop's `left_hand_side(node.receiver)`
/// behavior. This accepts `expect { work }.to \` followed by
/// `change { value }` and `.from(old)` using the outer expectation indentation,
/// while `have_enqueued_job(...)\n    .with(...)` still uses the ordinary
/// inner-chain indentation. The fix only climbs parent send nodes for the
/// indented fallback path, and the variant fixtures pin both sides of that
/// boundary.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-20)
///
/// The default `aligned` style still had one missing fallback-indentation case
/// in nested matcher chains passed as non-parenthesized arguments:
///
/// ```ruby
/// expect { work }.to \
///   have_enqueued_job(Job)
///     .with(id)
///     .and have_enqueued_job(Job)
/// ```
///
/// RuboCop computes the fallback indentation from `left_hand_side`, which
/// walks up parent send nodes to the outer `.to` call before applying the
/// usual visual-chain indentation. nitrocop was only using the immediate
/// multiline chain start (`have_enqueued_job(...)`), so it missed `.with` and
/// `.and` offenses indented four spaces too far.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-25)
///
/// Three remaining default-style divergences came from over-reusing semantic
/// anchors. A call with a single-line block whose receiver is a method on a
/// parenthesized expression, such as `(args || '').split\n  .yield_self {}`,
/// aligns with that receiver, and leading-dot matcher calls with descendant
/// multiline blocks, such as `.and change { ... }`, align with the receiver
/// matcher. Nested matcher chains that fall back to an outer send's
/// indentation must not validate an earlier bad continuation dot using only
/// the receiver subtree. Trailing-dot calls after a single-line block use
/// ordinary trailing-dot indentation rather than aligning with the
/// block-bearing receiver's inline dot.
///
/// The descendant-block-chain alignment must mirror RuboCop's
/// `node.each_descendant(:any_block).first` followed by `multiline?` check —
/// only the *first* descendant block (in source order) is consulted. If that
/// first block is single-line, the alignment must NOT apply, even if a later
/// descendant is a multiline `do ... end` block. Without this, long Sequel-
/// style chains (e.g. `DB[:t].with(:a, ...).with(:b, ...do...end)`) where
/// earlier `.with(...)` arguments contain single-line `{ }` blocks would
/// incorrectly suppress offenses on later `.with(...)` calls whose argument
/// happens to contain a multiline `do ... end`.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-26)
///
/// RuboCop's hash-pair handling still uses `left_hand_side(node.receiver)`,
/// which climbs through parent sends. For keyword/hash values that contain a
/// lambda body, that means a nested chain like
/// `t.grouping(\n  Arel::Nodes::Case.new\n    .when...)` aligns with
/// `t.grouping(`, not with `Arel::Nodes::Case.new`. Also, Prism attaches
/// multiline blocks directly to `CallNode`s; RuboCop's parser AST wraps them
/// in block nodes, so a later call after `.flat_map do ... end` must not reuse
/// `.flat_map` as a continuation anchor. Those calls fall through to the
/// assignment-RHS base instead.
///
/// ## Corpus fix (2026-04-27)
///
/// RuboCop's assignment RHS alignment is AST-based. A trailing-dot call nested
/// inside an operator RHS of an assignment, such as
/// `value = left || receiver.\n        call`, aligns with the start of the
/// whole assignment RHS, not with the nested receiver. The previous text scan
/// also treated unrelated `=` tokens inside earlier block arguments as
/// assignment context, which falsely flagged RSpec `change { x = y }` matcher
/// chains. Assignment bases now come from actual Prism write ancestors, and
/// semantic block-chain alignment ignores multiline block calls when they are
/// only the receiver of the current call. This accepts continuations after
/// completed block receivers, while still flagging assignment-RHS chains after
/// multiline block continuations.
