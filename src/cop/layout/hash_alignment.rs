/// Layout/HashAlignment checks that keys, separators, and values of multi-line
/// hash literals are aligned according to configuration.
///
/// ## Root cause analysis (corpus investigation, 2026-03-09)
///
/// The original implementation only checked key column alignment, missing:
/// - **Separator alignment** for hash rockets: `=>` must be exactly 1 space after key end
///   (in "key" style), or right-aligned (in "separator" style), or table-aligned.
/// - **Value alignment**: value must be exactly 1 space after separator end (in "key" style),
///   or aligned across all pairs (in "table"/"separator" style).
/// - **First pair checking**: even the first pair can have bad separator/value spacing.
/// - **Keyword splat alignment**: `**opts` must be aligned with the rest of the hash keys.
/// - **AllowMultipleStyles / array-valued config**: when EnforcedColonStyle or
///   EnforcedHashRocketStyle is an array (e.g., `[key, table]`), the cop picks the
///   style producing fewer offenses per hash.
///
/// These missing checks accounted for the vast majority of the 94K FN gap.
/// The 26 FPs were likely from edge cases in the key-only check.
///
/// ## FP/FN fixes (2026-03-14)
///
/// 1. **kwsplat-first reference bug (FP):** When a hash starts with `**opts` (keyword
///    splat), the cop was using the kwsplat as the alignment reference for key checks.
///    RuboCop uses `node.pairs.first` (first non-kwsplat pair). This caused spurious
///    key-alignment offenses on pairs that were correctly aligned with each other but
///    at a different column than the kwsplat. Fixed by introducing `first_pair()` helper
///    that skips kwsplats, matching RuboCop's behavior.
///
/// 2. **Table-style rocket value off-by-one (FP):** In table alignment for hash rockets,
///    the expected value column was computed as `key_col + max_key_len + sep_len + 1`,
///    missing the space before `=>`. RuboCop's `max_delimiter_width` for rockets is
///    `" => ".length` = 4 (includes both surrounding spaces). Fixed to use `+ 2` instead
///    of `+ 1` to account for spaces on both sides of `=>`.
///
/// 3. **Kwsplat inline with pairs (FP, 2026-03-14):** When a keyword splat (`**options`)
///    appears on the same line as other keyword args (e.g., `**options, method:,\n collection:,`),
///    `check_kwsplat_alignment()` was incorrectly comparing the kwsplat's column against the
///    first non-kwsplat pair's column. But when they share a line, column alignment is meaningless.
///    Fixed by skipping kwsplats that share a line with any non-kwsplat pair.
///
/// 4. **Remaining gap:** `is_call_arg` heuristic for `EnforcedLastArgumentHashStyle`
///    used `!begins_its_line` as a proxy for "is last argument of call," which was
///    wrong in both directions for explicit hashes:
///    - false negatives: plain hash assignments like `CONST = { ... }` were skipped
///      under `always_ignore` / `ignore_explicit` just because `{` did not begin the line;
///    - false positives: explicit last-argument hashes on their own line inside
///      calls/setters were still inspected, even though RuboCop ignores them.
///      Fixed by checking the Prism parent chain directly and only ignoring hashes
///      that are actually the last argument of a `CallNode`, `SuperNode`, or
///      `YieldNode`.
///
/// 5. **`&block` after explicit hash (`ignore_explicit` FN, 2026-04-16):** Prism stores
///    block-pass arguments as `BlockArgumentNode` on `call.block()` / `super.block()`,
///    not in `arguments()`. The previous last-argument check only looked at positional
///    arguments, so `foo({a: 1,\n  b: 2}, &block)` incorrectly treated the explicit hash
///    as the last argument and skipped it under `ignore_explicit`. RuboCop still inspects
///    that hash because the trailing `&block` is the actual last argument. Fixed by
///    treating a trailing `BlockArgumentNode` as disqualifying the hash from "last
///    argument hash" handling.
///
/// 6. **Multiline value alignment in `separator` / `table` styles (FN, 2026-04-17):**
///    the cop discarded `value_col` whenever a hash value started on the next line
///    (`"key" =>\n  value`). That matched `key` style, which ignores newline values,
///    but diverged from RuboCop for `separator` and `table`, where `Pair#value.loc.column`
///    is still aligned even across lines. This specifically missed first-pair offenses in
///    table style and multiline-proc/hash variants in the corpus. Fixed by keeping the
///    value column for non-omitted values and only suppressing newline value spacing in
///    `key` style.
///
/// 7. **Bundled `EnforcedStyle` alias + single-pair table hashes (2026-04-17):**
///    local variant validation passes `EnforcedStyle: rocket, colon, last_arg_style`
///    for this cop, but the implementation only read the split RuboCop keys. That left
///    `check_cop.py --style EnforcedStyle=...` effectively on default behavior. RuboCop
///    also checks the first pair in single-pair hashes under `table` style, while the cop
///    returned early unless there were at least two pairs. Fixed by parsing the bundled
///    alias in the cop and letting `check_table_style` inspect single-pair hashes.
///
/// 8. **Table-style alignment must use char width, not byte width (2026-04-17):** The
///    key length fed into `check_table_style`'s `max_key_len`/expected-column math was
///    `key_end - key_start` in bytes, while column positions are UTF-8 codepoint counts.
///    Hashes with multi-byte keys (emoji, CJK) therefore mis-computed the expected
///    separator/value columns and produced FPs whenever RuboCop would have accepted the
///    alignment. Fixed by counting non-continuation bytes (UTF-8 codepoint count) for
///    `key_char_len` so it composes with column math.
///
/// 9. **Variant-only shared-line + separator quirks (2026-04-20):**
///    - `table` / `separator` styles use RuboCop AST's `pairs_on_same_line?`, which treats
///      adjacent pairs as "same line" when a multiline pair's closing line also contains the
///      next pair (for example `}, :conditions => {`). The previous implementation only looked
///      at pair start lines, so `table, table, ignore_implicit` incorrectly flagged hashes that
///      RuboCop marks uncheckable.
///    - Under `separator` with hash rockets, RuboCop 1.84.2 crashes its autocorrection pass
///      (`Parser::ClobberingError`) when the first pair's value starts on the next line but
///      later pairs mix newline and same-line values. The corpus oracle counts that as zero
///      offenses, so nitrocop now suppresses that exact mixed-value shape to match RuboCop's
///      observable output.
///    - Under `separator` with colon pairs, RuboCop 1.84.2 crashes per-pair when the first
///      non-kwsplat pair uses Ruby 3.1 value omission (`foo:`) and a later non-omission
///      colon pair has a *strictly shorter* key. The crash aborts processing the remaining
///      pairs in that hash, but any offenses already emitted by earlier pairs are kept. So
///      `{ token:, uuid: creds[:uuid] }` reports no offenses (`uuid` < `token`), while
///      `{ token:, uuid_long: x }` still reports normally (`uuid_long` >= `token`). Mixed
///      colon/rocket pairs and same-length keys do not crash.
///
/// 10. **Separator-style newline-value corrector crashes (2026-04-25):**
///     RuboCop 1.84.2 aborts `separator`-style checking when the first non-kwsplat
///     pair's value starts on the next line, the first pair is also the widest key
///     in the hash, and a later non-omission pair needs a right-align key delta
///     larger than the indentation before that later newline value (for example
///     Conjur's `"Empty annotation name":` test-case hashes). The crash comes
///     from RuboCop's corrector trying to remove more spaces before the value than
///     exist on that line, causing the removal range to overlap the separator/key
///     edits. If the first pair is not the widest key, or the newline value's
///     indentation can absorb the key delta, RuboCop emits offenses normally.
///     Hash rockets keep the prior same-line-value suppression because RuboCop also
///     clobbers rocket pairs that are already separator-aligned (where key length
///     does not distinguish the crash shape); see the `"xml" =>`/`"uiinput" =>`
///     fixture.
///
/// 11. **Separator-style clobber abort is per-pair, not whole-hash (2026-04-26):**
///     RuboCop registers separator offenses in pair order and runs each correction
///     as the offense is added. When a later newline-value pair would make the
///     value-removal range reach back into the key line, RuboCop aborts at that
///     pair, preserving offenses already emitted for earlier pairs and dropping the
///     crashing pair plus the rest of the hash. This matters for Conjur-style
///     string-label hashes where one longer key is reported before subsequent
///     shorter keys disappear after the corrector clobber.
///
/// 12. **Variant batch `with_fixed_indentation` sibling config (2026-04-27):**
///     The generated `separator, separator, always_ignore` variant also flips
///     `Layout/ArgumentAlignment` to `with_fixed_indentation`. RuboCop's
///     `autocorrect_incompatible_with_other_cops?` only suppresses HashAlignment
///     when the hash's parent is a method call and the selector or preceding
///     argument shares the first pair's line. The previous nitrocop guard skipped
///     any inline explicit hash, including constant assignments and nested hash
///     values such as `locals: { user: ..., contributions: ... }`, causing the
///     large separator-style FN batch.
///
/// 13. **Clobber-abort threshold missed the separator's own width (FN, 2026-09-18):**
///     `separator_style_correction_clobbers`'s newline-value branch predicted a
///     corrector clobber whenever `key_delta > value_col + 1`, i.e. whenever the
///     backward value-removal reached past the value line's indentation and the
///     newline into the *previous* line at all. But that removal first consumes
///     the previous line's own separator token (`:` = 1 char, `=>` = 2 chars)
///     before it would reach into the key's own (independently edited) range --
///     only then does it actually clobber. The off-by-one-ish threshold caused
///     nitrocop to wrongly simulate a crash-and-abort for every pair past the
///     first whose right-align key delta landed in that now-too-narrow window,
///     silently dropping real offenses for the rest of the hash. Reproduced on
///     `DamirSvrtan/fasterer` `lib/fasterer/offense.rb`'s `EXPLANATIONS` constant
///     (18-pair hash with newline string values): nitrocop stopped after pair 14
///     (`proc_call_vs_yield`), dropping 5 real offenses (`gsub_vs_tr` and later).
///     Real RuboCop 1.84.2 does not crash on that file at all. Fixed by adding
///     `+ operator_len` (1 for `:`, 2 for `=>`) to the threshold, matching where
///     the removal range actually starts overlapping the key's own edit rather
///     than just crossing the line boundary. Verified against the existing
///     `emits_before_clobber` / `first_not_widest` / `first_value_newline_equal_key`
///     fixtures (unchanged results) plus a new boundary case one character inside
///     the old, wrong threshold.
///
/// 14. **Value-omission first pair silently skipped later pairs' value check
///     (FN, 2026-09-18):** RuboCop's `Pair#value` for a Ruby 3.1 value-omission
///     pair (`foo:`) is a synthesized node whose location equals the *key's* own
///     location -- there's no separate value token in the source. When such a
///     pair is `node.pairs.first` (the `separator`-style alignment reference),
///     `SeparatorAlignment#value_delta` still calls `first_pair.value_delta`,
///     which compares that synthesized column against each later pair's real
///     value column -- almost always non-zero, so RuboCop keeps flagging later
///     pairs even when their *keys* happen to align with the omitted first key.
///     nitrocop stored `value_col: None` for an omission pair and skipped the
///     comparison entirely whenever `first.value_col` was `None`, which silently
///     accepted alignment (no offense) for every subsequent non-omission pair
///     whose key length matched or exceeded the first pair's -- exactly the
///     `{ foo:, bar: "x", baz: }`-shaped hash produced by Ruby's `def to_hash;
///     { attr:, other: value, attr2: }; end` pattern. Reproduced across dozens of
///     `antiwork/gumroad` `app/models/*_bank_account.rb` files and
///     `Shopify/ruby-lsp` `test/fixtures/hash_literal_omitted_values.rb`. Only
///     matters when `first` is the omission pair; a *non-first* omission pair
///     was already handled correctly (RuboCop forces its own value delta to 0
///     unconditionally, and nitrocop's `pair.value_col: None` already produced
///     that skip). Fixed by introducing `first_pair_effective_value_col`, which
///     returns the first pair's own key-start column when it is a value
///     omission, and using it in both the colon/colon and rocket/rocket value
///     comparisons. This is a distinct bug from the `rubocop_crashes_on_omission_pair`
///     abort added for finding 9 above, which only fires when the *first
///     non-omission* pair's key is strictly shorter than the omitted first key;
///     equal-or-longer keys (as in the bank-account hashes) never triggered that
///     abort and instead hit this value-comparison gap.
