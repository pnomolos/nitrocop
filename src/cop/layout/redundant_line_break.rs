/// Layout/RedundantLineBreak: Checks whether certain expressions that could fit
/// on a single line are broken up into multiple lines unnecessarily.
///
/// ## Implementation approach
/// Two-phase detection:
/// - **Phase 1 (AST)**: Visits CallNode and assignment write nodes. Uses walk-down
///   with `checked_chain_ranges` to approximate RuboCop's walk-up-to-outermost behavior.
/// - **Phase 2 (text)**: Detects backslash line continuations that could be collapsed.
///
/// ## Key differences from RuboCop
/// - RuboCop walks UP from `on_send` through parent sends, convertible blocks, and
///   binary operators to find the outermost expression. Nitrocop walks DOWN and uses
///   `checked_chain_ranges` + `part_of_reported_node` to approximate this.
/// - RuboCop's `configured_to_not_be_inspected?` only skips multiline blocks
///   (`any_descendant?(node, :any_block, &:multiline?)`). Nitrocop now matches this
///   by tracking multiline vs single-line blocks separately.
/// - RuboCop's `other_cop_takes_precedence?` is conditional on
///   `Layout/SingleLineBlockChain` being enabled. Nitrocop now mirrors that by
///   using an injected `SingleLineBlockChainEnabled` flag from config.
///
/// ## Remaining gaps (FNs)
/// - No walk-up through `AndNode`/`OrNode` (binary operators) — standalone multiline
///   `&&`/`||` expressions without assignment are not checked.
/// - No walk-up through convertible blocks (`method { ... }.chain`) — the block is not
///   merged with its send_node for length calculation.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-03-09)
/// - Phase 2 now checks block and unsafe ranges before reporting backslash continuations.
/// - Added `ParenthesesNode` to unsafe ranges (maps to `:begin` in Parser AST).
/// - Fixed `too_long` method chain dot check to match RuboCop's `(?=(&)?\.\w)` regex.
/// - Split block range tracking into multiline-only (`contains_multiline_block`)
///   for more accurate InspectBlocks handling.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-03-16)
/// - **Critical FP fix**: `UnsafeRangeCollector` now recurses into all node types
///   (DefNode, IfNode, CaseNode, etc.). Previously it stopped recursing when it hit
///   these nodes, so multiline strings/regexps/arrays nested inside methods or
///   conditionals were never collected as unsafe ranges. This caused ~thousands of FPs
///   in repos like slim-template (315 FPs from multiline %q{} strings inside def bodies).
/// - Added all missing operator/or/and write node visitors for instance variables,
///   class variables, global variables, constants, and constant paths (e.g.,
///   `@count += items.size`, `@@total += n`, `$var ||= compute`).
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-01)
/// - Fixed keyword-argument false negatives inside multiline chained block
///   expressions. Previously a multiline outer call like `items.each do ... end`
///   could mark its entire byte range as "checked" and suppress inner
///   multiline calls in the block body. The fix remains deliberately narrow:
///   contained calls are only unsuppressed for the validated keyword-hash
///   argument shape when they are the direct, sole statement inside a
///   multiline block body.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-03)
/// - Extended that narrow block-body unsuppression to `map` blocks too.
///   RuboCop does flag direct multiline keyword-hash calls such as
///   `search_results.map do ... extract_uris(...) end`, but nitrocop still
///   excluded them because only `each`/`select`-style iterators were
///   allowlisted. Keeping the same structural guards and only adding `map`
///   recovers those FNs without broadening to unrelated block shapes.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-04)
/// - **String value check**: `UnsafeRangeCollector` now uses
///   `StringNode::unescaped()` to check decoded string values for `\n`,
///   matching RuboCop's `safe_to_split?` which checks `n.value.include?("\n")`.
///   Previously only source-level newline bytes were checked, causing:
///   - FPs: strings with escape sequences like `"AT+CLAC\r\n"` were not marked
///     unsafe (source has no literal newline), so calls containing them were
///     incorrectly flagged.
///   - FNs: string concatenations with `\` line continuation like
///     `"foo" \ "bar"` were falsely marked unsafe (source spans lines), so
///     calls containing them were incorrectly suppressed.
/// - **Block body exclusion**: `checked_chain_ranges` now excludes block bodies.
///   In RuboCop, the send node's range does not include the block (the block is
///   a parent node), so calls inside block bodies are checked independently.
///   In Prism, `CallNode` includes the block, so the old code suppressed ALL
///   calls inside block bodies of chains. Now only the chain portion (up to the
///   block start) is marked as checked. Additionally, `part_of_checked_chain`
///   now checks whether a node is inside a block body within the chain range
///   (via `inside_block_body_within_chain`), so calls like `extract_uris(...)`
///   inside `search_results.map do ... end.flatten` are correctly unsuppressed
///   even when the outer chain's range encompasses the block body.
/// - **Non-convertible block handling**: When a `CallNode` has a block that is NOT
///   convertible (i.e., the call has arguments but no parentheses, like
///   `config.wrappers :default, ... do |b| ... end`), the offense check now uses
///   the "send-only" range (up to the block start) instead of the full range.
///   In RuboCop's Parser AST, `on_send` walks up through convertible blocks but
///   stops at non-convertible ones, checking only the send portion. This recovers
///   ~2,653 FNs and resolves ~616 FPs with zero regressions.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-06)
/// - **Data structure nesting check**: `part_of_checked_chain` now uses
///   `is_nested_in_data_structure()` to allow calls nested inside hash, array,
///   or other data structures within a chain to be checked independently. In
///   RuboCop, `on_send` walks up only through parent `send_type?` nodes. Calls
///   inside hashes (`key: match_array([...])`), arrays, or splats have non-send
///   parents (pair, hash, array) that stop the walk-up, so they're checked
///   independently. Previously, nitrocop's byte-range-based `checked_chain_ranges`
///   suppressed ALL calls within a chain's range, including these nested calls.
///   Resolves ~1350 FNs (e.g., `match_array(...)` inside `have_attributes(...)`)
///   with zero regressions.
/// - **`too_long` backslash fix**: The combined-line length calculation now only
///   strips trailing line-continuation backslashes, not ALL backslash characters.
///   Previously, `combined.retain(|&b| b != b'\\')` removed content backslashes
///   like `\1_\2` in regex replacements and `\d` in character classes, making
///   the combined line appear shorter than it actually is. This caused FPs for
///   method chains containing regex patterns where the true combined length
///   exceeded 120 chars but the backslash-stripped version didn't. Resolves
///   ~594 FPs with zero regressions.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-07)
/// - Added missing visitor handlers for `IndexOperatorWriteNode`, `IndexOrWriteNode`,
///   `IndexAndWriteNode`, `CallOperatorWriteNode`, `CallOrWriteNode`, and
///   `CallAndWriteNode`. Previously, index operator writes like `foo[bar] ||= value`
///   and call operator writes like `obj.method += value` were not visited, causing
///   FNs for these patterns. These handlers ensure the `check_assignment` method is
///   invoked for these node types, enabling detection of redundant line breaks in
///   index/call operator write expressions. Resolves ~2 FNs with zero regressions.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-08)
/// - **Direct argument walk-up**: nested multiline calls used as direct arguments
///   of an outer multiline call are now suppressed when the outer call has already
///   been checked. RuboCop's `on_send` walks from the inner send to its parent send
///   even when that parent relation comes from an argument position, not only a
///   receiver chain. Nitrocop previously only tracked receiver chains, which caused
///   false positives for cases like `SeedDump.dump(EventInstance\n.where(...), ...)`
///   and similar backslash-heavy argument lists.
/// - **Multiline regexp safety**: Prism represents a plain regexp as a single
///   `RegularExpressionNode`, but Parser exposes newline-containing regexp bodies
///   through descendant `:str` nodes. RuboCop therefore treats multiline regexps as
///   unsafe in `safe_to_split?`. Nitrocop now explicitly marks multiline regexp
///   literals unsafe so assignments like `GROUPED_INPUT_PATTERN = /.../x.freeze`
///   are no longer falsely flagged.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-08, second batch)
/// - **Binary operator walk-up**: RuboCop's `on_send` walks up through parent
///   `OrNode`/`AndNode` (both `||`/`&&` and `or`/`and`). After walking up,
///   `operator_keyword?` returns true for these nodes, and `require_backslash?`
///   gates the offense on the operator line ending with `\`. Without `\`, no
///   offense is registered on ANY send inside the expression. Nitrocop did not
///   perform this walk-up, so multiline calls that were the RHS of `||`/`&&`
///   (e.g., `destroy || raise(...)`, `must_not_cache? || stale?(...)`) were
///   incorrectly flagged. The fix adds `inside_binary_op_without_backslash()`
///   which walks up the ancestor stack following RuboCop's walk-up rules and
///   suppresses offenses when the binary operator line lacks a trailing `\`.
///   Resolves ~144 FPs and ~51 FNs with zero regressions.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-09)
/// - **Trailing `&.` join length**: RuboCop's single-line suitability
///   check collapses safe-navigation chains split after a trailing `&.` like
///   `foo&.\n  bar` without inserting a space. Nitrocop only handled the
///   leading-dot form (`foo\n  .bar`), so it overestimated joined length for
///   these safe-navigation chains and skipped real offenses when the true
///   joined line fit under the configured maximum.
/// - **Unary `!` wrapper anchoring**: Prism exposes `!foo&.\n  bar` as an
///   outer unary-`!` call wrapped around the multiline send, but RuboCop
///   reports the underlying send start (`foo`, not `!`). Nitrocop now skips
///   that wrapper so the inner call is checked and anchored like RuboCop.
/// - **Unary `!` wrapper narrowing**: that skip only applies to safe-navigation
///   receiver chains. RuboCop still reports ordinary unary-negated multiline
///   sends such as `!foo.\n  bar` and `!checks.values.\n  find { ... }`, but
///   nitrocop was skipping every unary-`!` wrapper and missing those offenses.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-09, second batch)
/// - **UTF-8 character counting**: `too_long()` and Phase 2's combined-line check
///   now measure character length instead of byte length, matching RuboCop's
///   `String#length` which counts characters. Previously, multi-byte characters
///   (CJK, accented, etc.) inflated the measured length, causing FNs for lines
///   that fit within 120 characters but exceeded 120 bytes. Fixed by adding
///   `utf8_char_count()` which counts non-continuation bytes. Resolves ~92 FNs
///   (e.g., BCDice repo with Japanese text).
/// - **Phase 2 unsafe range overlap**: Phase 2's `has_unsafe` check now detects
///   unsafe ranges that START within the backslash group but extend beyond it
///   (e.g., case/until/while expressions on the continuation line). Previously
///   only ranges fully contained within the group were detected, causing FPs for
///   patterns like `foo || \ case @mode ... end` and `parent \ until cond`.
///   Resolves ~41 FPs (e.g., ruby2js repo). Added `UntilNode`, `WhileNode`, and
///   `ForNode` visitors to `UnsafeRangeCollector` to support modifier keywords.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-10)
/// - **String continuation merging in `too_long`**: RuboCop's `to_single_line`
///   merges adjacent string literals across backslash continuations:
///   `"foo" \ "bar"` → `"foobar"` (same quotes), `"foo" \ 'bar'` → `"foo" + 'bar'`
///   (different quotes). Nitrocop's `too_long` previously joined these lines with
///   a space, keeping both sets of quotes: `"foo" "bar"` — 2 extra characters per
///   continuation. For deeply-indented expressions with string continuations, this
///   caused the combined length to exceed 120 chars when RuboCop's version fit,
///   resulting in FNs. For example, `raise ArgumentError, "long..." \ "msg"` inside
///   a 4-level-deep nesting would measure 124 chars (nitrocop) vs 117 chars (RuboCop).
///   Added `merge_string_continuation()` helper and `prev_had_backslash` tracking in
///   `too_long` to match RuboCop's merging behavior.
/// - **Phase 2 comma-tail span**: the text-based backslash pass now keeps walking
///   through immediately-following comma-terminated lines before measuring length.
///   RuboCop judges the whole continued call (for example `attr_reader \` followed
///   by many symbol arguments), but nitrocop previously only joined the backslash
///   line with the very next line. That produced false positives for long DSL-style
///   argument lists that still obviously continued after the first continuation line.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-11)
/// - **Non-convertible block chain suppression**: outer sends such as
///   `expect(...).to receive(:find) do ... end.and_return(...)` were still
///   marking their full Prism byte range as "checked", which suppressed the
///   inner send that actually owns the non-convertible block. RuboCop stops its
///   `on_send` walk-up at that block boundary, so the multiline `expect(` /
///   `expect_any_instance_of(...).` send is the real offense target. Nitrocop
///   now lets call nodes that own a non-convertible block bypass outer
///   `checked_chain_ranges` suppression so those RSpec chains are checked at the
///   same boundary RuboCop uses.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-12)
/// - **Phase 2 comment guard**: backslash continuations with inline comments in
///   the continued lines (for example `attr_reader \` lists with trailing
///   `# DEV(...)` comments) are now skipped. RuboCop will not collapse those
///   comment-bearing expressions onto one line.
/// - **Phase 2 branch-tail string continuations**: backslash string
///   continuations that end directly before `else`/`elsif`/`when`/`rescue`/`end`
///   are skipped without suppressing unrelated nested expressions. This matches
///   RuboCop for string continuations inside `if ... else ... end` assignments
///   while avoiding the broad FN regression from suppressing whole enclosing
///   conditional ranges.
/// - **Multiline interpolated string safety**: interpolated strings that contain
///   literal newlines are now marked unsafe-to-split as whole nodes, except for
///   `%`-newline delimiters like `x = %\n"#{foo}"` where the delimiter newline is
///   not part of the string's effective value. RuboCop treats expressions like
///   `\"<h2>#{\n  call\n}</h2>\"` as unsafe, but still flags newline-delimited
///   percent strings that fit on one line.
/// - **Safe-navigation block-chain precedence**: `Layout/SingleLineBlockChain`
///   only takes precedence for ordinary `.` chains, not `&.` chains. Nitrocop
///   now matches that by excluding safe-navigation callers from the
///   single-line-block precedence collector, so patterns like
///   `registry\n  .find { ... }\n  &.command_class` are correctly reported.
/// - **Phase 2 enclosing-expression guard**: the text fallback now skips
///   backslash groups that are already covered by a larger multiline AST call
///   chain, or by a class-header inheritance span like `class Foo < \ Bar`.
///   RuboCop judges those larger expressions as a whole, so nitrocop must not
///   emit extra inner reports for long operator chains or superclass headers.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-17)
/// - **SingleLineBlockChain gating**: `configured_to_not_be_inspected()` now
///   only defers to `Layout/SingleLineBlockChain` when that cop is actually
///   enabled in the resolved config. Previously the precedence check was always
///   active, so repos that disabled `Layout/SingleLineBlockChain` still had
///   multiline chains like `e.select { ... }\n  .join` suppressed here, causing
///   false negatives relative to RuboCop.
/// - **Stabby lambda precedence**: RuboCop's
///   `other_cop_takes_precedence?` also considers single-line stabby lambdas
///   (`-> { ... }`) whose containing send has a dot. Nitrocop only tracked
///   `BlockNode`, so multiline dotted calls like
///   `assoc.has_many ..., -> { ... }, ...` and outer wrappers like
///   `assert_equal(..., obj.call(-> { ... }))` were incorrectly flagged even
///   though `Layout/SingleLineBlockChain` should take precedence.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-20)
/// - **Phase 2 ternary predicates**: backslash-continued predicates inside
///   multiline `?:` expressions are now measured against just the predicate
///   span instead of being blocked by the enclosing ternary's unsafe range.
///   The text fallback also anchors those reports at the first non-whitespace
///   column and keeps the `foo \n && bar` / `foo \n || bar` skip disabled only
///   for ternary predicates. This recovers FNs like
///   `o.col_type.nil? \ && ... \ ? ... : ...` without broadening ordinary
///   multiline `&&` / `||` handling.
/// - **Config-sensitive safe-navigation contexts**: corpus examples like
///   `!current_course_user&.\n  email_unsubscriptions...` only reproduce when
///   `Layout/LineLength` is wide enough for the indented chain to collapse.
///   Keep those in config-specific tests rather than the default fixture so
///   shared fixtures do not encode repo-specific line-length settings.
/// - **CRLF line endings**: `too_long()` and the backslash fallback now strip
///   trailing `\r` as well as spaces/tabs. Prism's line slices preserve the
///   carriage return byte in CRLF files, but RuboCop's `processed_source.lines`
///   length check does not treat that byte as visible source content. Without
///   trimming it, expressions that fit exactly at `MaxLineLength` in CRLF files
///   were measured one character too long per line and incorrectly suppressed.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-25)
/// - **Safe-navigation chain boundary with trailing blocks**: outer `&.` calls
///   that own a trailing block (for example `receiver&.select { ... }&.values`)
///   still form a safe-navigation boundary for the immediately nested send even
///   though `checked_chain_ranges` truncates the outer range before the block
///   body. Nitrocop now keys that boundary check off the nearest ancestor call
///   start, which recovers FNs like
///   `(@document[...] || {})\n  &.select { ... }\n  &.values` without
///   unsuppressing earlier plain-send segments in the same chain.
/// - **Backslash `if`/`unless` condition anchoring**: the text fallback now
///   reports backslash-continued `if`/`unless` conditions from the condition
///   expression, not from the keyword indentation. This matches RuboCop for
///   cases like `if foo && \` newline `bar`.
/// - **Full-line suitability measurement**: even when RuboCop reports an inner
///   call that starts mid-line (for example the RHS of an assignment), its
///   `too_long?` check still joins the full physical lines in the span. Keep
///   nitrocop aligned with that behavior; slicing the start/end columns causes
///   false positives on long regex-heavy chains that RuboCop accepts.
/// - **Parser unsafe range parity**: `case` pattern matching, `for`, `while`,
///   and `until` nodes are no longer treated as AST unsafe-to-split ranges
///   because RuboCop's `safe_to_split?` does not include those node types.
///   They remain Phase 2 blocking ranges where needed for modifier backslash
///   contexts. The backslash fallback also now anchors `elsif` and leading
///   parenthesized continuation groups at RuboCop's reported expression column.
/// - **Backslash lexical guards**: the text fallback now skips condition
///   headers whose source is only `if`, `elsif`, or `unless` before a trailing
///   backslash, where RuboCop reports no offense, while still allowing a
///   same-line condition ending in `&&` plus a trailing backslash to be flagged.
///   It also treats Ruby's `$\\` global variable as source content rather than
///   a line continuation marker.
///
/// - NOTE: The CLI does not properly enable this preview cop even with `--preview`.
///   Unit tests bypass CLI filtering and work correctly.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-26)
/// - **Direct ternary arm split**: RuboCop does not report a backslash on a
///   predicate line when the next physical line is already the leading `?`
///   ternary arm (`predicate \` newline `? then : else`). Nitrocop's text
///   fallback now skips only that direct shape while still reporting longer
///   backslash-continued predicates before a later ternary arm.
/// - **Modifier return/unless and mixed operators**: The text fallback now
///   anchors `return unless condition || \` at the condition expression, and
///   only suppresses `foo \` newline `&& bar` when the first line is not already
///   a boolean operator expression like `foo || bar \`.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-04-27)
/// - **Multistatement class body safety**: Prism models class bodies as a
///   `StatementsNode`, while Parser exposes a multiline `begin` descendant when
///   the body has multiple statements. The unsafe range collector now treats
///   those multistatement class bodies as unsafe so class expressions ending in
///   `.new` are not falsely collapsed, while single-statement class receivers
///   remain reportable like RuboCop.
/// - **Corpus-derived continuation coverage**: command-style split strings,
///   chained assignments, and boolean operator backslash continuations are
///   covered in fixtures while preserving the broad value-only split-string
///   guard needed for RuboCop-accepted hash values, return expressions, and
///   long call arguments.
///
/// ## Fixes applied (2026-09-18)
/// - **Verbatim `to_single_line` port**: `too_long` no longer reconstructs the
///   joined line by trimming each physical line and gluing them with a single
///   space. It now joins the raw lines of the span with `\n` and applies
///   RuboCop's five `to_single_line` substitutions literally (via
///   `regex::bytes`, with the backreference expanded into the two same-quote
///   cases and the `(?=(&)?\.\w)` lookahead emulated by a capture). Two
///   whitespace details were the actual divergence:
///   - trailing whitespace on the **last** line of the span is never followed
///     by a newline, so nothing strips it — `params[...] = {` … `}  ` measures
///     121 chars in RuboCop and 119 in the old reconstruction (scinote-web
///     `repository_rows_service_spec.rb`, LubyRuffy/fofa `ziptest.rb`);
///   - the chain-dot rule `/\n\s*(?=(&)?\.\w)/` consumes only the newline
///     and the *following* indent, so the previous line's trailing padding and
///     its line-continuation backslash both survive into the joined string
///     (xwmx/pandoc-ruby `test_pandoc_ruby.rb`, tamc/excel_to_code).
///
///   Sampled corpus effect (21 repos reproducing the oracle's per-repo counts):
///   FP 39 → 23, FN unchanged.
